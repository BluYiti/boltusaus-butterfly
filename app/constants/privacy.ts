I am to participate in telebehavioral health with A.M.Peralta Psychological Services as part of my consultation/counseling and psychotherapy. I understand that telebehavioral health is the practice of delivering mental health care services via technology between a licensed mental health care practitioner and a client such as myself. Furthermore, I understand the guidelines indicated below with respect to telebehavioral health.

1) I understand that there are risks, benefits, and consequences associated with telebehavioral health, including but not limited to, disruption of transmission by technology failures, interruption and/or breaches of confidentiality by unauthorized persons, and/or limited ability to respond to emergencies.

2) I understand that there will be no recording of any of the online sessions by either party. All information disclosed within sessions and written records pertaining to those sessions are confidential and may not be disclosed to anyone without written authorization, except where the disclosure is permitted and/or required by law.

3) I understand that the privacy laws that protect the confidentiality of my protected health
information also apply to telebehavioral health unless an exception to confidentiality applies (i.e. mandatory reporting of child, elder, or vulnerable adult abuse, danger to self or others; I raise mental/emotional health as an issue in a legal proceeding).

4) I understand that if I am having suicidal or homicidal thoughts, actively experiencing psychotic symptoms or experiencing a mental health crisis that cannot be resolved remotely, it may be determined that telebehavioral health services are not appropriate and a higher level of care is required.

5) I understand that during a telebehavioral health session, we could encounter technical difficulties resulting in service interruptions. If this occurs, end and restart the session. If we are unable to reconnect within ten minutes, please call me at 09266696242 to discuss since we may have to re-schedule.

6) I understand that my therapist may need to contact my emergency contact and/or appropriate authorities in case of an emergency but in the event that my therapist is not available when I happen to be in an emergency situation, I understand that I am to contact other emergency providers and follow necessary emergency procedures that my therapist is to give to me upon my consent.
